<p align="center">
  A modular 8-bit computer, built from the ground up.
</p>

## :brain: Overview

**8b1c** is an open-source hardware project focused on building a complete 8-bit microcomputer from scratch — one chip, one module at a time.  
Each component is designed to be standalone, reusable, and easy to integrate into the full CPU.

## 🧷 Main Repository

[`8b1c/8b1c-computer`](https://github.com/8b1c/8b1c-computer) is the main project repository, where all the modules come together into a fully working 8-bit computer.

## 📐 Project Goals

- Make the architecture of an 8-bit computer easy to understand and build.
- Create reusable, well-documented modules with schematics and test setups.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

- Fork and clone any module repository you want to work on.
- Check out the documentation and schematics.
- Open an issue for bugs, questions, or suggestions.
- Submit a pull request if you have a fix or feature.

## 📄 License

All modules are released under open-source licenses. Check each repository for specific license details.
